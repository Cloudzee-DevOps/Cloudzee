    <p>Cloud costs are one of the biggest challenges for startups and enterprises. Many Azure users pay for idle resources, unmanaged VMs, and lack visibility into spending.</p>

    <p>This is where <strong>Terraform</strong> helps. By writing infrastructure as code (IaC), you can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Auto-tag resources for cost tracking across teams.</li>
      <li>Shut down non-production workloads automatically at night.</li>
      <li>Standardize deployments using reusable Terraform modules.</li>
      <li>Enable auto-scaling for VMs and AKS clusters to handle traffic spikes efficiently.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>👉 In one project, we reduced monthly Azure spend from <strong>$10,000 to $7,000</strong> — a direct <strong>30% saving</strong> — by automating with Terraform.</p>

    <p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Terraform is not just for faster provisioning; it’s a <strong>cost optimization tool</strong> when applied correctly.</p>
